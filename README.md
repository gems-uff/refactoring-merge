# Refactoring and Merge Effort

This project aims to analyze the relationship between the occurrence of refactorings and the merge effort.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python, pygit2, libgit2, Mysql and RefactoringMiner, and it was tested on the following versions:

```
python==3.6
pygit2==0.27.0
libgit2==0.27.0
mysql==8.0.23
RefactoringMiner==2.1
```

### Preparing the runtime environment:

#### Install libgit2/pygit2

First of all, if you are using Mac OS or Linux you need to install libgit2. If you have Anaconda installed in your computer, you can simple do:

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge libgit2
```

Otherwise, on Mac OS you can install libgit2 using homebrew:

```
$ brew install libgit2
```

On Linux you can install the latest version of libgit2 by doing:

```
$ wget https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/archive/v0.27.0.tar.gz
$ tar xzf v0.27.0.tar.gz
$ cd libgit2-0.27.0/
$ cmake .
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```

For more information http://www.pygit2.org/install.html

#### Install Mysql

1. Open the terminal and run the following command:

```
sudo apt update
```

2. Enter your password and wait for the update to finish.

3. Next, run:

```
sudo apt upgrade
```
4. Install

```
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

#### Install RefactoringMiner

We are using version 2.1 of RefactoringMiner. More details about the tool and installation steps can be found at: https://github.com/tsantalis/RefactoringMiner.

#### Clone Refactoring-Merge Project

URL: https://github.com/gems-uff/refactoring-merge.git.


#### Create the Database

The script for creating the database in mysql can be found in the file "script_database.sql" in the output folder of this project.

## Basic Usage

### Mining repositories on GitHub

Mining cloned repositories must be carried out in three steps: collecting branches, collecting code refactorings, and calculating the merge effort. The script that collects the branches must be the first to be executed. The other scripts are independent and can be executed in any order.

#### Script 1 - Collect Branches

```
./script_1_colllect_branches.py --database [data_base_name] --repo_path [local_repository_path]
```

Parameters:
```
--database = (mandatory) database name.
--repo_path = (mandatory) local path to where the Git project repository was cloned.
--log = (optional) boolean parameter indicating the need to print the execution log.
--retry (optional) boolean parameter indicating the need to retry the execution. This retry is only applicable when the repository is updated via git pull.
```

#### Script 2 - Collect Refactorings

```
./script_2_collect_refactorings.py --database [data_base_name] --repo_path [local_repository_path] --refminer_path [refminer_path] --arq_ref_miner [refminer_path_output_file] 
```

Parameters:
```
--database = (mandatory) database name.
--repo_path = (mandatory) local path to where the Git project repository was cloned.
--refminer_path = (mandatory) Refactoring Miner tool executable code path.
--arq_ref_miner = (mandatory) .json file name that will store the results returned by the Refactorings Miner tool.
--log = (optional) boolean parameter indicating the need to print the execution log.
--retry (optional) boolean parameter indicating the need to retry the execution. This new attempt is applicable in cases of interruptions in script execution or in Refactoring Miner timeout situations.
```

#### Script 3 - Calculate Merge Effort

```
./script_3_calculate_merge_effort.py --log --database [data_base_name] --repo_path [local_repository_path]
```

Parameters:
```
--database = (mandatory) database name.
--repo_path = (mandatory) local path to where the Git project repository was cloned.
--log = (optional) boolean parameter indicating the need to print the execution log.
--retry (optional) boolean parameter indicating the need to retry the execution. This new attempt is applicable in cases of interruptions in the execution of the script or in situations of timeout in the effort calculation.
```

### Building the Dataset

To build the dataset for the application of the data mining technique (extraction of association rules) just run the script "extract_merge_commits_score.py":

```
./extract_merge_commits_score.py --branches --selected_refactorings --datasetname ['datasetname.csv']

```

Parameters:
```
--branches = (optional) boolean parameter indicating the need to split refactoring attributes into two branches (b1 and b2). When not informed, the script will sum the total of refactorings of each type in the two branches.
--selected_refactorings = (optional) boolean parameter indicating the need to compute only selected refactorings. When informed, the script will only consider the 33 types of refactorings considered in this study.
--datasetname = (optional) name of the produced dataset. When not informed, the script will save in the "output" folder a csv file with the following name: "merge_refactoring_ds.csv"
```

## Project corpus and dataset used in our latest study

Our latest study evaluated 64 open-source projects. The table below shows the characteristics of the projects selected for analysis, presenting the number of commits (**NC**), the number of merge commits (**NMC**), the number of merge commits using the *--no-ff* flag (**NMC-off**), and the number of valid merge commits (**NVMC**). The final version of the dataset discarded about 28.3% of the merges because they were generated by the Git commandÂ *--no-ff*, resulting in **91,270 merge commits**.

The study were conducted with **64 open-source projects** between **May 30, 2024**, and **June 1, 2024**.

This folder contains two compressed .csv files: **ds_os_join.csv** and **ds_os_split.csv** (available in this repository - folder *project-corpus*). Each dataset row represents a merge commit and its collected/calculated attributes. In the first one, the total number of refactorings for each type is added without considering the branch on which it was implemented. In the second one, these amounts are separated by branches.
